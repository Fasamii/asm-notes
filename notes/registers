Evry CPU has general purpose registers and some special registers e.g.:
	- x86_32-bit CPU has:
		- General purpose registers such as:
			- %eax
			- %ebx
			- %ecx
			- %edi
			- %esi
		- And some special purpose registers:
			- %ebp <- base pointer register
			- %esp <- stack pointer register
			- %eip <- instruction pointer register
			- %eflags <- status register

		!! Depending on architecture each register can hold 32-bit data for 32-bit CPU and 64-bit for 64-bit CPU
